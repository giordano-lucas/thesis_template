\begin{abstract}

%The abstract serves as an executive summary of your project.
%Your abstract should cover at least the following topics, 1-2 sentences for
%each: what area you are in, the problem you focus on, why existing work is
%insufficient, what the high-level intuition of your work is, maybe a neat
%design or implementation decision, and key results of your evaluation.
